## @mercadopago/sdk-react — Component Map

| Component | Use for | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `CardPayment` | Card-only payment form (Checkout API / Bricks) | Tokenizes card, calls your server on submit |
| `Payment` | Full multi-method form (cards + wallets + cash) | Superset of CardPayment |
| `Wallet` | Mercado Pago wallet button (one-click) | Buyer must be logged into MP account |
| `StatusScreen` | Post-payment result screen | Requires `payment_id`, NOT `order_id` |
| ~~`CardForm`~~ | **Does not exist** | Use `CardPayment`. Any `CardForm` import is a hallucination. |

Install: `npm install @mercadopago/sdk-react`
Vanilla JS CDN: `<script src="https://sdk.mercadopago.com/js/v2"></script>`

## Products

### Checkout Pro

**What it is:** Hosted redirect checkout. The buyer leaves your site, pays on Mercado Pago's secure page, and returns via `back_url`. Mercado Pago handles all card data — no PCI scope for you.

**When to use:**
- You want the fastest integration with minimal frontend work
- You don't need to keep the buyer on your page during payment
- You want Mercado Pago's full payment method catalog (saved cards, MP balance, cash, BNPL) with zero configuration

**When NOT to use:**
- You need the buyer to stay on your page (use Bricks or Checkout API instead)
- You need granular control over the payment form layout

**Key payload fields (create preference):**
```json
{
  "items": [{ "title": "Product", "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 100.0, "currency_id": "ARS" }],
  "back_urls": {
    "success": "https://yoursite.com/success",
    "failure": "https://yoursite.com/failure",
    "pending": "https://yoursite.com/pending"
  },
  "auto_return": "approved",
  "notification_url": "https://yoursite.com/webhooks/mp",
  "external_reference": "order-uuid-here",
  "statement_descriptor": "YOUR STORE"
}
```

**Use `init_point`** from the preference response to redirect the buyer. Never use `sandbox_init_point` (deprecated, returns errors).

**Best practices:**
- Always set `external_reference` for reconciliation
- Always verify payment status server-side after redirect — never trust `back_url` query params alone
- `auto_return: "approved"` requires `back_urls.success` set; otherwise silently ignored
- `currency_id` must match the country (ARS, BRL, MXN, CLP, COP, PEN, UYU)
- The Orders API does NOT exist for Checkout Pro — always use `/checkout/preferences`

### Checkout API (Orders mode)

**What it is:** Card payments processed entirely on your page. Buyer never leaves your site. Full control over the UI. Also called **Checkout Transparente** in Brazil.

**When to use:**
- You need the buyer to stay on your page
- You want full UI customization
- You're building a card-only or card-primary checkout

**Modes:**
- `orders` (recommended, new integrations) — uses `/v1/orders`
- `payments` (legacy) — uses `/v1/payments`. Still works but being deprecated.

**Flow (Orders mode):**
1. Client tokenizes the card via Mercado Pago JS SDK or Bricks `CardPayment`
2. Client sends card token + amount to your server
3. Server creates an order via `POST /v1/orders` with the card token
4. Server returns order status to client

**Key order creation payload:**
```json
{
  "type": "online",
  "processing_mode": "automatic",
  "total_amount": "100.00",
  "external_reference": "order-uuid",
  "payer": { "email": "buyer@example.com" },
  "transactions": {
    "payments": [{
      "amount": "100.00",
      "payment_method": {
        "id": "master",
        "type": "credit_card",
        "token": "<card_token_from_frontend>",
        "installments": 1,
        "statement_descriptor": "YOUR STORE"
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Always send `X-Idempotency-Key` header on every creation request
- `issuer_id` is required for some BINs in Argentina — include it when returned by tokenization
- Card tokens are single-use and expire in 7 days
- `installments` is required even for 1 in Argentina (MLA)
- For 3DS: set `binary_mode: false` on the payment to allow `pending` status (3DS challenge)
- Brazil queries: use "checkout transparente orders node brazil" in MCP `search_documentation`

### Checkout Bricks

**What it is:** Modular, pre-built React/JS UI components that handle card tokenization, payment method selection, and status display. PCI-compliant without touching card data directly.

**When to use:**
- You want a polished, ready-made checkout UI with minimal frontend work
- You want card tokenization handled by Mercado Pago (no PCI scope)
- You need to support multiple payment methods (cards + cash + wallet)

**Variant contracts:**

| Variant | SDK component | Backend behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Card Payment | `CardPayment` / `cardPayment` | Tokenizes card; `onSubmit` creates a Payments API payment |
| Payment | `Payment` / `payment` | Multi-method form; `onSubmit` creates the selected method through Payments API |
| Wallet | `Wallet` / `wallet` | Mount with a preference created dynamically at `/checkout/preferences` |
| Status Screen | `StatusScreen` / `statusScreen` | Mount with an existing Payments API `payment.id`; does not create a payment |

**Critical behavior:**
- `onSubmit` for Payment/Card Payment must return a Promise and settle only after the server response. Returning void leaves the Brick loading.
- Wallet preference IDs are generated server-side per checkout session. Never hardcode a placeholder; the preferences path has no version segment.
- Status Screen receives `paymentId`, not an Orders API order ID.
- The vanilla mount container must exist before `bricksBuilder.create()`; retain and unmount the returned controller before rebuilding it.
- React SDK components manage their own controller lifecycle.
- Ad-blockers can block `sdk.mercadopago.com` and produce `FIELDS_SETUP_FAILED`.
- Debit cards do not show an installments selector; that is expected behavior.
- Show the trusted total above Payment/Card Payment and scaffold initializing, processing, success, and actionable error states.
- Load `MP_PUBLIC_KEY` through the framework's public configuration mechanism or a no-store runtime JSON endpoint; never substitute a placeholder into cached HTML.

### QR Code

**What it is:** In-person payments where buyers scan a QR code on a display or printed sticker to pay via the Mercado Pago app.

**When to use:**
- Physical point of sale (retail, restaurants, events)
- Self-service kiosks
- Cashierless checkout

**Modes:**
| Mode | Use case | TTL |
|------|----------|-----|
| Static | Fixed QR per POS — buyer enters amount or amount is preset | No TTL |
| Dynamic | One QR per transaction — most secure and auditable | Short TTL per transaction |
| Hybrid | Static QR + amount displayed on screen | Per transaction |

**Setup flow (all QR modes):**
1. Create a Store via the Stores API
2. Create a POS linked to that store via the POS API and retain its `external_id` and static QR response
3. Create a QR order via `POST /v1/orders` with `type: "qr"`, `config.qr.external_pos_id`, and `config.qr.mode`
4. Display the QR to the buyer
5. Receive webhook notification when buyer pays

**Best practices:**
- Store + POS are prerequisites and are never silently auto-created with an invented address
- Dynamic and hybrid use `type_response.qr_data`; static uses the QR returned by POS creation
- Wire new integrations only to the `orders` topic
- Use `external_pos_id` for reconciliation across multiple registers

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/qr-code/landing

---

### MP Point

**What it is:** Physical card reader terminals (Point Smart 1, Point Smart 2) controlled through the Orders API. Accepts chip, NFC, magnetic stripe, and QR.

**When to use:**
- Physical retail with unified POS management
- Businesses needing automatic reconciliation across terminals
- When you want to create payment intents from your system and push them to a device

**Flow:**
1. Pair the physical terminal to a User ID (NOT just the application) and enable PDV mode
2. Create a `type: "point"` order via `POST /v1/orders` with `config.point.terminal_id`
3. The terminal loads the order and the buyer pays on the device
4. Receive an `orders` webhook and reconcile the returned order/payment IDs

**Testing without hardware:**
- Use the standard virtual terminal `NEWLAND_N950__SBX0000001` with app test credentials
- Create a fresh order per scenario and simulate the result through `POST /v1/orders/{order_id}/events`
- Exercise `processed`, `failed`, `refunded`, `canceled`, `expired`, and `action_required`
- The virtual terminal is not valid for official integration-quality measurement or final hardware validation

**Critical gotchas:**
- New integrations must use Orders API; `/point/integration-api/.../payment-intents` is deprecated
- Use `type: "point"` and `config.point.terminal_id`; `type: "instore"` and `config.device.id` are invalid for this flow
- A production device must be paired to the correct User ID — wrong user pairing silently rejects orders
- After a firmware update the device may take ~2 min to come back online; don't retry aggressively
- Webhook topic for Orders API is `orders`. The legacy `point_integration_wh` topic belongs to the old API — do not use for new integrations
- A physical terminal is still required for final card, PIN, printing, connectivity, and production checks

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/mp-point/landing

---

### Subscriptions

**What it is:** Recurring automated payments on a weekly, monthly, or yearly schedule. Mercado Pago handles retries on failure.

**When to use:**
- SaaS, memberships, clubs
- Donation platforms (variable amounts)
- Subscription boxes or recurring services

**Three integration contracts:**
| Contract | How | Buyer experience |
|-------|-----|---------|
| With plan | Provision a reusable `preapproval_plan`; create each `preapproval` with its server-controlled ID, a secure card token, and `authorized` status | Card is tokenized on the merchant page |
| Without plan, authorized | Create `preapproval` with trusted recurrence terms, a secure card token, and `authorized` status | Card is tokenized on the merchant page |
| Without plan, pending | Create `preapproval` with trusted recurrence terms and `pending` status, without a token | Redirect buyer to returned `init_point` to select a payment method |

**Minimal payloads:**
```jsonc
// With plan
{
  "preapproval_plan_id": "<server-controlled-plan-id>",
  "payer_email": "subscriber@example.com",
  "card_token_id": "<single-use-secure-token>",
  "external_reference": "subscription-uuid",
  "back_url": "https://yoursite.com/subscription/confirm",
  "status": "authorized"
}

// Without plan, pending
{
  "reason": "Monthly membership",
  "external_reference": "subscription-uuid",
  "payer_email": "subscriber@example.com",
  "auto_recurring": {
    "frequency": 1,
    "frequency_type": "months",
    "transaction_amount": 100,
    "currency_id": "BRL"
  },
  "back_url": "https://yoursite.com/subscription/confirm",
  "status": "pending"
}
```

**Best practices:**
- A `preapproval` without `preapproval_plan_id` cannot be migrated to a plan later — choose model upfront
- Never ask a buyer to paste a token and never collect raw card fields. Authorized contracts tokenize with MercadoPago.js CardForm or Card Payment Brick; pending omits the token and redirects through `init_point`.
- Plan ID, amount, currency, frequency, billing rules, and trial settings are trusted server-side configuration, not browser input.
- Associated-plan subscriptions do not repeat browser-supplied recurrence terms; the plan owns them.
- Recurring charges retry automatically on failure; `paused` status is reachable both manually and after N failed attempts
- `back_url` for plan signup must be HTTPS in production
- Monitor `subscription_preapproval_plan`, `subscription_preapproval`, `subscription_authorized_payment`, and `payments` webhook topics as applicable

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/subscriptions/landing

### Marketplace

**What it is:** Split Payments 1:1 where each connected seller authorizes the marketplace through OAuth and the selected checkout applies the platform commission.

**When to use:**
- Platforms with multiple sellers (e marketplace, on-demand services, gig economy)
- When you need to split a payment between your platform and a seller

**How it works:**
1. Seller authorizes your platform via OAuth flow → you receive seller's access token
2. Resolve the trusted seller/cart and create the selected checkout using the seller OAuth token
3. Funds split automatically at settlement

**Supported contracts:**
- Checkout Pro: exactly `/checkout/preferences` + `marketplace_fee`
- Checkout API/Transparente: `/v1/payments` + `application_fee`
- Wallet Brick: exactly `/checkout/preferences` + `marketplace_fee`, dynamic `preferenceId`, and `marketplace: true`

**Checkout API key payload:**
```json
{
  "transaction_amount": 100.0,
  "application_fee": 5.0,
  "token": "<single_use_card_token>",
  "installments": 1,
  "external_reference": "<trusted_order_id>"
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Generate and consume one-time OAuth `state`; require the exact configured redirect URI
- Encrypt seller access/refresh tokens at rest and rotate both values atomically on refresh
- Use the seller OAuth access token in the backend Authorization header; never expose it to the browser
- Derive seller, items, amount, and commission from trusted server-side state
- Do not add `collector_id` to the payment payload; OAuth `user_id` is stored as the seller connection identity
- Sellers must explicitly authorize your platform — there is no silent linking

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/split-payments/split-1-1/overview

---

### Wallet Connect

**What it is:** One-click payments using the buyer's saved credentials in their Mercado Pago wallet, without re-entering card details.

**Availability:** Commercially enabled product, not self-service. Confirm that
Mercado Pago enabled the application before scaffolding or calling its APIs.

**When to use:**
- Mobile commerce apps where buyers already have MP accounts
- Reducing checkout friction for returning buyers
- Subscription-like flows where you want to reuse buyer's saved payment method

**Flow:**
1. Server creates an agreement and redirects the buyer to the returned approval URI
2. Buyer explicitly approves linking in the Mercado Pago wallet UI
3. Server exchanges the one-time approval code for a payer token and stores it encrypted
4. Server uses that payer token to create an idempotent `online` order through Orders API

**Best practices:**
- Buyer must explicitly approve the linkage via MP wallet UI — no silent linking possible
- The payer token and approval code are server-only; never return, log, or store them in the browser
- Derive buyer identity, purchase amount, and reconciliation reference from authenticated server state
- Once linked, payments use buyer's saved methods — do not pass card details or load MercadoPago.js
- Orders use `type: "online"`, wallet payment method, matching two-decimal amounts, and a unique idempotency key
- Handle webhook notifications for agreement status changes and order reconciliation
- Do not substitute Wallet Brick or Advanced Payments for the Orders API contract

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/wallet-connect/landing

---

### Payouts (legacy alias: Money Out)

**What it is:** A privileged, server-only transfer from the integrator's
Mercado Pago balance to trusted destination accounts. It is not a buyer
checkout, Marketplace split, Advanced Payment, or public withdrawal form.

**Country boundary:** The current contract is country-specific. Argentina uses
batch Payouts; Brazil uses a single Transaction Intent. Resolve the site before
scaffolding and never copy one country's payload into another. For any other
country, require a verified current country guide before generating code.

**Critical boundaries:**
- Require operator authorization and load destination, amount, currency, and
  reconciliation data from durable trusted server state
- Persist one idempotency key per logical instruction and reconcile accepted
  resources asynchronously through lookup plus Webhooks
- Make test mode explicit and isolated from production
- Sign the exact serialized production body with the registered Ed25519 key
- Do not add a CTA, public payment page, card fields, MercadoPago.js, or a
  public key

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/payouts/overview

---

### SmartApps

**What it is:** A private business-management application distributed to
Mercado Pago Point Smart terminals through a closed approval process. Main apps
become the terminal's primary interface; mini apps are launched from the
terminal marketplace.

**Non-negotiable prerequisites:**
- Active contact/agreement with the Mercado Pago business and integration team
- Android target application and Android Studio
- Private development kit with the current SmartApps AAR
- Mercado Pago development terminal with the approved test firmware for full testing

**Critical boundaries:**
- Never scaffold into a web/backend/iOS project as if it were a SmartApp
- Always query the authenticated MCP for the current product guide
- Ask before copying/updating the private AAR and use only the latest artifact
  confirmed by the integration team
- Payment and terminal capabilities are invoked through the SmartApps SDK, not
  through direct Android hardware permissions or browser/server SDKs
- Static validation does not replace compilation with the real AAR, tests on a
  development terminal, or Mercado Pago homologation

**Docs:** https://www.mercadopago.com.{country}/developers/en/docs/smartapps/overview

### MP Point API (Orders API — current)

The Point endpoints migrated from the legacy Payment Intent API to the Orders API. Use the **`/terminals/v1/`** family for device management and **`POST /v1/orders`** for transactions.

| GET | `/v1/orders/{orderId}` | Get order status |

> **Legacy (Payment Intent API) — do NOT use for new integrations:** `GET /point/integration-api/devices`, `POST /point/integration-api/devices/{deviceId}/payment-intents`. These still work but are superseded by the Orders API above.

**List terminals:**
```js
await fetch('https://api.mercadopago.com/terminals/v1/list?limit=50&offset=0', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});
// terminals[].id format: "NEWLAND_N950__N950NCB801293324" (type + "__" + serial)
```

**Create order on terminal:**
```js
await fetch('https://api.mercadopago.com/v1/orders', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-Idempotency-Key': crypto.randomUUID() },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: 'point',
    external_reference: 'order-uuid',
